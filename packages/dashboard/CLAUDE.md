# packages/dashboard — React Web Dashboard

The local web UI served at `http://localhost:3002` when the CLI API server is running. A private (unpublished) Vite/React app bundled into the CLI's static assets.

See root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) for monorepo conventions.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** React 19 + Vite 7 + TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Markdown:** react-markdown + remark-gfm (for AI chat responses)
- **Build output:** `dist/` — served as static files by the CLI's Express server (`packages/cli/src/server/api.ts`)

**The entire app is in a single component file:** `src/App.tsx` (~121KB). There is no routing library; the UI is tab-based with local state. When the app grows enough to warrant splitting, extract tab panels into `src/components/`.

---

## Build

```bash
# From packages/dashboard/:
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build → dist/

# Dev (connects to CLI API server at localhost:3002):
npm run dev       # Vite dev server with HMR

# From repo root:
npm run build:dashboard
```

The CLI's API server must be running (`blissful-infra dashboard` or `blissful-infra up`) for the dashboard to have data.

## API integration

All data comes from the CLI API server at `http://localhost:3002`. The dashboard uses standard `fetch()` — no HTTP client library.

Key endpoints consumed:

| Endpoint | Used for |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/projects` | Project list on load |
| `GET /api/projects/:name` | Project details + service status |
| `GET /api/projects/:name/logs` | Log viewer (polled) |
| `GET /api/projects/:name/metrics` | Metrics charts (polled) |
| `GET /api/projects/:name/deployments` | Deployments tab — history with latency delta |
| `POST /api/projects/:name/up` | "Restart" button action |
| `GET /api/projects/:name/traces` | Jaeger trace links in Deployments tab |

---

## Tab structure

The dashboard has these top-level tabs (managed in `App.tsx` local state):

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Project list, service health status, quick actions |
| **Logs** | Real-time log streaming per service |
| **Metrics** | CPU, memory, request latency charts (Recharts) |
| **Deployments** | Deployment history — git SHA, status badge, P95 latency before/after delta, Jaeger trace link |
| **AI Chat** | Conversational interface to the AI agent (streams responses from the API) |

---

## Deployment tracking UI

In the Deployments tab, each row shows:
- Git SHA (7 chars)
- Status badge: `running` (blue), `success` (green), `failed` (red)
- P95 latency delta: `+12ms` / `-8ms` vs previous deployment (color-coded)
- Jaeger trace link (opens Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`)
- Duration in seconds
- Timestamp

Data comes from `GET /api/projects/:name/deployments` which reads JSONL from `~/.blissful-infra/deployments/<project>.jsonl`.

---

## Adding a new tab or feature

1. Add a new tab name to the tab list state in `App.tsx`.
2. Add a tab button in the nav row.
3. Add the corresponding panel in the conditional render block.
4. If the tab needs new API data, add the endpoint to `packages/cli/src/server/api.ts` first.

Keep new panels in `App.tsx` for now unless the component exceeds ~200 lines, at which point extract to `src/components/<TabName>.tsx`.
